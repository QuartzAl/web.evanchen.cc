What position am I in?
An endless game I cannot win.
Some people here are so obsessed,
With the 24th letter of the alphabet.
I do not admit that I understand,
Why everyone tells me that I’m banned.
Ohio, rizzler, gyatt, and sigma
It will always be an enigma.
What they mean, they wouldn’t spoil it
But I think it had to do with skibidi toilet.
Xooks xoinks, pointless degen
Even sane people argue whether grass is vegan
I’m done with this, it’s over, screw it
But behind me Benjamin Fu says xiooix
As for sane people I find nobody
I guess I can only say “So ba d”
Sanity was lost long ago
Just like how Eye Lost the gaMe, Ohno.
Wherever I go there are geo mains
Projective techniques are frying my brain
I don’t care about geo affinity
I project my voice to infinity!
Your hyperbola got you seven points
I don’t get it, I thought you could only pass it through five
I admit I’m running out of things to say
Something, Something radioactive decay
I keep writing and I start slow
But all that’s in my brain is xooks rbo
So I think it’s time we start winding down
Pretend we’re in a test and start counting down
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh (however many it takes to get people to say it with me) (maybe happy new year?)
You might think I’m just a ‘nnoying yapper
But I’m really representing the Consortium of Bellevue Asian Underground Rappers.
(Stones can form inside the gall bladder)
(Don’t touch receipts or climb a ladder)
(Follow these simple pieces of advice)
(In this presentation you have lost the game thrice)
