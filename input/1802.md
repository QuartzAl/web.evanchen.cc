description: Uploads for stuff for 18.02 recitation

---

This is a place where I post notes that I typed
when leading my 18.02 recitation at Mass Tech in fall 2024.

Current students: here's the [attendance form](https://forms.gle/mmbC8q7jwiw9MBgw5).

## Downloads (i.e. optional DLC's)

These materials contain lots of side digressions and alternative perspectives.
They are not considered part of the course,
and you should not feel obligated to read them; they're just for your interest.

- `MT1` [Bonus review problems for Midterm 1](/upload/1802/bonus1.pdf)

- `R03 09/11` [Encoding lin maps as matrices](/upload/1802/r03.pdf)

## Quick temporary answer keys for recitations

These are really hastily cobbled together and might contain mistakes.
It's mostly useful for checking your work;
there will be a proper solutions file prepared by the TA's later on Canvas.
This is just a stopgap in the meantime since the official solutions
file usually takes an extra day or two to go online.

- `R03 09/16` [Answer key for R04](/upload/1802/r04s.pdf)
- `R03 09/11` [Answer key for R03](/upload/1802/r03s.pdf)
