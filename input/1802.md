description: Uploads for stuff for 18.02 recitation

---

This is a place where I post random stuff that I typed
when leading my 18.02 recitation at Mass Tech in fall 2024.

Current students: here's the [attendance form](https://forms.gle/mmbC8q7jwiw9MBgw5).

## Downloads (i.e. optional DLC's)

Most of these materials are side digressions that I typed up.
They are not considered part of the course,
and you should not feel obligated to read them; they're just for your interest.

## Quick temporary answer keys for recitations

These are really hastily cobbled together and might contain mistakes.
It's mostly useful for checking your work;
there will be a proper solutions file prepared by the TA's later on Canvas.
This is just a stopgap in the meantime since the official solutions
file usually takes an extra day or two to go online.

## For current students

My recitation is **9:05-9:55am on Mondays and Wednesdays in 2-135**.
My office hours right afterwards in **Mondays 10am in 2-136**,
but you can also email me to schedule a separate office hours appointment
if you want, or just go to a different TA's office hours.
(I'm going to ask the admins if I can also get the office hours room on Wednesday.)
